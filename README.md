# Possibility

_Possibility_ is a 2D game developed as part of a themed senior high school project (2022) by a team of three collaborators. The theme was duality which we translated into the game using Java and Slick2D through the mechanics of reversing gravity.

## üìú Project Description

_Possibility_ is a 2D side scroller and platformer consisting of 8 levels where the player has to obtain a key to pass through the level door. 

### Features:
- **Gravity Switch**: A box interactable with an arrow indicating which way gravity will be flipped. There is a cooldown at the bottom left of the screen that shows when you can flip gravity again.
- **Spike**: A triangular obstacle that will kill the player if touched. There are stationary spikes and moving spikes, which activate once the player passes the x-coordinate of the spike.
- **Ice**: A rectangular obstacle, usually embedded into the floor, that will freeze horizontal movement until the player leaves the ice.
- **Surfboard**: A box-shaped obstacle that moves very freely when the player stands on top of it. Gravity affects the surfboard, but not as much as it does with the player.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

While this project served as a great learning experience, there are many areas where I plan to improve or expand on it in the future:

- **Improve AI Behavior**: The current enemy AI could be more dynamic and challenging.
- **Better Level Design**: Future versions will feature more engaging and creative level designs.
- **Graphics and Animations**: The visual assets can be refined, and animations can be smoother.
- **Sound Design**: I'd like to add more sound effects and background music to enhance the atmosphere.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Eventually, I plan to port the game to [platforms like mobile, web, etc.].
