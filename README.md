## üöÄ Future Improvements

While this project served as a great learning experience, there are many areas where I plan to improve or expand on it in the future:

- **Improve AI Behavior**: The current enemy AI could be more dynamic and challenging.
- **Better Level Design**: Future versions will feature more engaging and creative level designs.
- **Graphics and Animations**: The visual assets can be refined, and animations can be smoother.
- **Sound Design**: I'd like to add more sound effects and background music to enhance the atmosphere.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Eventually, I plan to port the game to [platforms like mobile, web, etc.].
