# Possibility

This repository contains a game I developed during my high school years. It was a great learning experience and an opportunity to experiment with game mechanics, programming, and design. As I continue to improve my skills throughout college, I hope this project serves as a benchmark to track my growth in game development and coding.

## 🗎 Project Description

[Game Title] is a [type of game: platformer, puzzle, adventure, etc.] where the player [brief description of gameplay mechanics and objective]. The goal of the game is to [what the player needs to achieve] while navigating through various levels filled with challenges and obstacles.

### Features:
- **Core Mechanics**: [briefly describe core gameplay mechanics]
- **Graphics/Art Style**: [e.g., pixel art, minimalist, etc.]

## 🙭 Future Improvements

While this project served as a great learning experience, there are many areas where I plan to improve or expand on it in the future:

- **Improve AI Behavior**: The current enemy AI could be more dynamic and challenging.
- **Better Level Design**: Future versions will feature more engaging and creative level designs.
- **Graphics and Animations**: The visual assets can be refined, and animations can be smoother.
- **Sound Design**: I'd like to add more sound effects and background music to enhance the atmosphere.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Eventually, I plan to port the game to [platforms like mobile, web, etc.].
